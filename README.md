> Simple beer inventory display

### ✨ [Demo, pints.me](https://pints.me)

The site is a very simple inventory display written in yew. It is built from a
csv and allows for searching a filtering with some predefined graphs.

## Install

If you don't already have it installed, it's time to install Rust:
<https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>. The rest of this guide assumes a
typical Rust installation which contains both `rustup` and Cargo.

To compile Rust to WASM, we need to have the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
installed. If you don't already have it, install it with the following command:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Now that we have our basics covered, it's time to install the star of the show:
[Trunk]. Simply run the following command to install it:

```bash
cargo install trunk wasm-bindgen-cli
```

### Running

```bash
trunk build index.html
cargo run --bin server -- --dir dist
```

### Release

```bash
trunk build --release
```
