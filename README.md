## Install

If you don't already have it installed, it's time to install Rust:
<https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>. The rest of this guide assumes a
typical Rust installation which contains both `rustup` and Cargo.

To compile Rust to WASM, we need to have the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target
installed. If you don't already have it, install it with the following command:

```bash
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

Now that we have our basics covered, it's time to install the star of the show:
[Trunk]. Simply run the following command to install it:

```bash
cargo install trunk wasm-bindgen-cli
```

## Usage

Before building you will need to add credentials to the `.env` file or set them
in the shell env. see `.env.sample` or below

```sh
PROJECT_ID="<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>"
SPREADSHEET_ID="<YOUR_SPREADHEET_ID>"
CLIENT_EMAIL="<SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL>"
PRIVATE_KEY_ID="<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY_ID>"
PRIVATE_KEY="<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>"
```

You can get the `SPREADSHEET_ID` from the URL of your sheet,
`https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/<SPREADSHEET_ID>/edit#gid=12345`. You
will have to create a service account which will provide you with the service
account email id and a private key. To know more about creating service account
you can visit [here](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7378726?hl=en) and read
[this](https://www.twilio.com/blog/2017/03/google-spreadsheets-and-javascriptnode-js.html).
After creating a service account share your sheet with edit permission with the
given email id.

### Running

```bash
trunk serve
```

Rebuilds the app whenever a change is detected and runs a local server to host
it.

### Release

```bash
trunk build --release
```
